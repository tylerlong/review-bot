Glip has integrations with other project management tools that keep our communication and projects organized in one central place. We can organize with folders, sort and search, save links, create notes, add files, and even video chat directly from Glip. Not only is it our ninja weapon for efficiency, but our company culture even centers around Glip; we can even make custom emoji's! I've been with Glip for over 2 years and they continue to stay ahead of the curve. It's like they know the next thing I'm going to need and by the time I'm asking for it, it's being delivered! And their mobile app is incredibly useful! My only advice is that you truly take the time to discover how it can work for you. There's not a manual and there are so many different ways to accomplish the same thing.
